Bayesian Analysis is a statistical method based on Bayes' Theorem, which provides a probabilistic framework for reasoning about uncertainty. Unlike traditional (frequentist) statistics, which focuses on fixed parameters and data collected from repeated experiments, Bayesian analysis treats both parameters and data as uncertain and utilizes probabilities to quantify that uncertainty.
