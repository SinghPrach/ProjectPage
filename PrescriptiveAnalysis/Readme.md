Prescriptive analysis is a type of data analysis that goes beyond understanding what has happened (descriptive analysis) or predicting what could happen (predictive analysis). It provides actionable recommendations for decision-making, offering insights on what actions to take to achieve desired outcomes. Prescriptive analysis suggests the best course of action based on data, modeling, and optimization techniques.
