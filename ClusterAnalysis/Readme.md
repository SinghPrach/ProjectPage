Cluster Analysis is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique that aims to group similar data points or objects into clusters, based on their inherent similarities. The goal of cluster analysis is to organize a dataset into subsets (or clusters) where the data points within each cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. It helps to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in data without prior knowledge of the outcomes or labels.
