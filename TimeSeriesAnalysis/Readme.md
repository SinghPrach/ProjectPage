Time Series Analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze and forecast data points that are collected or recorded at regular intervals over time. It focuses on understanding the underlying structure of a time-ordered dataset, identifying patterns, and making predictions based on historical trends. Time series data can come from various fields, including finance (e.g., stock prices), economics (e.g., GDP), weather (e.g., temperature), sales (e.g., monthly revenue), and more.
