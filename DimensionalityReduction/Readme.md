Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in machine learning and statistics to reduce the number of features (variables) in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible. In other words, it is the process of transforming data from a high-dimensional space (with many features) into a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to visualize, analyze, and model without sacrificing much information.
